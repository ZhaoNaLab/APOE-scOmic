# Notes
Following preprocessing of the scRNAseq dataset, we identified subclusters of microglia (MG) that, based on visualizing marker gene expression, were closer to macrophage than microglia. These were clusters 8, 9, and 11 from the original clustering (from the Seurat FindClusters call), which correspond to the clusters 8, 9, and 10 in the manuscript.
