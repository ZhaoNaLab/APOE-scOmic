# APOE-scOmic-Qiao
This repository contains analysis and visualization code for the APOE-scOmic project, examining how human APOE genotypes modulate the aging process of microglia and astrocytes at both transcriptional and translational levels. 
# Project Overview
This project investigates how human APOE genotypes affects the transcriptome profile of mciroglia and astrocytes at single cell level, as well as in-depth proteome profile of sequntially isolated microglia and astrocyte, respectively.
# Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:
ScRNA-seq analysis for microglia: Contains codes for data processing, microglia clustering, differential expressed gene (DEG) identification, and senescence and blue module score calculation. 
Microglia proteome analysis: Contains codes for data processing, differential expressed protein (DEP) identification, Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA).
ScRNA-seq analysis for astrocytes: Contains codes for data processing, astrocyte clustering and DEG identification. 
Astrocyte proteome analysis: Contains codes for data processing, DEP identification and WGCNA.
