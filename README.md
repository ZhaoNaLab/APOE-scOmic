# APOE-scOmic
This repository contains analysis and visualization code for the APOE-scOmic project, examining how human APOE genotypes modulate the aging process of microglia and astrocytes at both transcriptional and translational levels. 
# Project Overview
This project investigates how human APOE genotypes affects the transcriptome profile of mciroglia and astrocytes at single cell level, as well as in-depth proteome profile of sequntially isolated microglia and astrocyte, respectively.
# Project Structure
The repository includes the analysis and visualization code for single cell RNAseq and proteome datasets.
